for some reason it cant find the path to Django. 

so i need to work out where that is and add it to my python path. 

python path:

'/home/alex/.virtualenvs/superlists/lib/python36.zip', '/home/alex/.virtualenvs/superlists/lib/python3.6', '/home/alex/.virtualenvs/superlists/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload', '/usr/lib/python3.6', '/home/alex/.virtualenvs/superlists/lib/python3.6/site-packages']


path to django: 

<module 'django' from '/home/alex/.virtualenvs/superlists/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/__init__.py'>
